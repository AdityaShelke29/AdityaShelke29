# Hi, I'm Aditya! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computer science and mathematics undergrad at the University of Maryland, with a possible minor in robotics. In my free time, I love to play the guitar, draw, watch anime, or go to the gym. Favorite animes are Attack on Titan and Steins;Gate. Also a big Star Wars fan.

**What am I up to?**
- Learning React and some web development skills to use in hackathons and to create a proper version of [**this**](https://devpost.com/software/courseconnected) project I made with my friends called CourseConnected. (https://devpost.com/software/courseconnected)
- Following Andrew Ng's machine learning course to create models from scratch in C++. (love that guy)
- Trying not to fail my CS classes (Ã—_Ã—) ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­

**Here's some cool stuff that I've done:**
- Co-authored a paper on a model nanoparticle anticancer drug delivery system. Utilized MATLAB and differential equations to simulate the motion of superparamagnetic nanoparticles in the bloodstream. (https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.015104)
